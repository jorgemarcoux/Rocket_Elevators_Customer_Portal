<h2>Week 11</h2>
This week we focused on creating a MVC application using ASP.NET
We used the Identity library to authentificate the users.

All the vlidation and data displaying was possible thanks to the REST API that I built on previous weeks. In order to request data to the API, I used AJAX and JQuery.
